### Hi there! 👋

I'm Angelo, a *curious* Software Engineer with a strong dedication to software development and data-driven solutions. 

Here's a quick snapshot of what keeps me busy:

- Day job: Software Engineer with a focus on Oracle DB development 🖥️
- Night shift: Data Engineer, diving deep into data solutions 🔍
- Free time: Indie hacker and aspiring entrepreneur, always on the lookout for the [next project](https://retroquest.app/)💡
- Passions: Self-improvement books 📖, Personal finance 💰, and Automation games 🎮 (I'm a big [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) fan!)

Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations or if you have any interesting ideas! 😉
